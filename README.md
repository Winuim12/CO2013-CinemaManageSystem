## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Winuim12/CO2013-CinemaManageSystem.git
cd CO2013-CinemaManageSystem
````

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Configure the Database

* If using **SQLite (default)**, no additional setup is needed.
* If using **MySQL/PostgreSQL**, update `config.py` with your DB credentials.

Run migrations (if applicable) or initialize your database:

```bash
# Example (may vary based on how models are defined)
python app.py
```

---

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see output like:

```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
